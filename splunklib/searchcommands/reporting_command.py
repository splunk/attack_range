class ReportingCommand(SearchCommand):
    """ Processes search result records and generates a reporting data structure.

    Reporting search commands run as either reduce or map/reduce operations. The reduce part runs on a search head and
    is responsible for processing a single chunk of search results to produce the command's reporting data structure.
    The map part is called a streaming preop. It feeds the reduce part with partial results and by default runs on the
    search head and/or one or more indexers.

    You must implement a :meth:`reduce` method as a generator function that iterates over a set of event records and
    yields a reporting data structure. You may implement a :meth:`map` method as a generator function that iterates
    over a set of event records and yields :class:`dict` or :class:`list(dict)` instances.

    ReportingCommand configuration
    ==============================

    Configure the :meth:`map` operation using a Configuration decorator on your :meth:`map` method. Configure it like
    you would a :class:`StreamingCommand`. Configure the :meth:`reduce` operation using a Configuration decorator on
    your :meth:`ReportingCommand` class.

    You can configure your command for operation under Search Command Protocol (SCP) version 1 or 2. SCP 2 requires
    Splunk 6.3 or later.
